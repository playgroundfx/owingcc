Accountability has been a hot topic for me lately as I have been showing
my trading account consistently in my Turning Pro challenge. I wanted
everyone to see how the impact of [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) wins and losses affects your
trading account as a whole. However, the unintended lesson for me was
how the accountability of being transparent with my trading account
actually affected my performance.

As I mentioned in the video, this is the last week the Trade Room will
be accepting new members. Anyone who enrolls in it by the end of the
week will have lifetime access to it at the current price. I will be re-
launching the Trade Room as a part of a larger program in the near
future, however, it will be at a higher price point. So, if you are
looking for accountability, enroll into the Trade Room by the end of the
week to have access at the current price point.
