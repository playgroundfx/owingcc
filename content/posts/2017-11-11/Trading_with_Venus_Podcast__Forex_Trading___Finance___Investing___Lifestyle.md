One of the questions, I hear often is "How do I trade the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)?"
Personally, I don’t trade the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/). I’m essentially a day trader so I
tend to stay out of the currency when the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) comes out. However, that
may not be possible for everyone, especially when you’re trading long
term.

Therefore, I’ve invited our special guest today to answer that
particular question for you. Our guest today is Rob Colville and while
chatting I mentioned this question to him. Because this question is not
a quick one to answer, he was kind enough to put together a presentation
for us. Rob was a guest on our previous show, episode 10. If you’d like
to hear his trading journey, I invite you to check out episode 10.
