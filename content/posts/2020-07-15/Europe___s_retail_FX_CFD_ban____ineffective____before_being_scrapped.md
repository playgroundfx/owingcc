The European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) recently confirmed
it would not renew the temporary restriction on the [marketing,
distribution or sale of CFDs][2] to retail clients in the EU.

A spokesperson for the securities markets regulator said this decision
was taken on the basis that most national competent authorities (NCAs)
had taken permanent, national product intervention measures that were at
least as stringent as Esma’s.

The only notable outlier is Poland, where the financial supervision
authority Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (KNF) decided to introduce an
additional level between retail and professional status – ‘experienced’
– where clients can trade with a maximum leverage of 1:100.

The KNF justified the lower margin requirement by referencing the
results of surveys conducted by the authority and a Polish association
of investment firms, which it said indicated that many Polish clients
had opened an account with a broker registered outside of the EU to
access higher leverage.

### Offshore trading

It is impossible to know the exact extent to which this has happened,
since offshore brokers don’t report their client numbers or volumes.

However, FXCM CEO Brendan Callan notes an increase in applications for
licences in jurisdictions such as Mauritius, Seychelles and Gibraltar.

Anthony Sharpe, head of compliance at Hantec Markets, observes that most
regulated brokers now have an [offshore organization where retail
clients can trade at the previous leverage limits][3].

“This has added a little more integrity to offshore trading, as traders
can use reputable companies,” he says.

“However, the ultimate aim of protecting retail clients has completely
failed, with traders now trading under the same [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) they were prior to
the intervention, but with none of the protections afforded to them
under EU [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s.”

XTB experienced a decline of more than 15% in active client numbers in
the immediate aftermath of the [measures taken by Esma in August
2018][5], says its CEO Omar Arnaout.

A [report published by the US National Bureau of Economic Research][6]
in late 2017 and updated in June this year found that leverage caps in
the US retail FX market had lowered high leverage traders’ losses by
40%.

Esma may have been encouraged by the observation of the report’s authors
that overconfident traders are disproportionately attracted to markets
with high leverage and typically generate poor net returns.

It might also have noted the report’s conclusion that “the growth of the
foreign exchange brokerage market has been socially excessive and that a
leverage constraint [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) is an effective tool to reduce this excess”.

However, feedback from brokers suggests the EU leverage limit has had
minimal impact on retail client profitability.

“Our average percentage of profitable clients per quarter since the new
rules were introduced is 26.6%, which is very close to the pre-
intervention ratio of 28%,” says FXCM’s Callan. “The biggest factor in
client profitability is volatility, not leverage.”

XTB’s Arnaout says the change in profitability at his firm has also been
limited.

“Prior to Esma’s intervention, just under 71% of our clients lost
money,” he adds. “Over the following 12 months, just under 65% of
clients lost money.”

A number of brokers reported an increase in applications for
professional client status after the imposition of leverage limits for
retail clients.

“The number of professional clients has increased since the intervention
measures came into force, although those Mifid brokers adhering to the
definition of a professional client and ensuring their clients are
sufficiently qualified would not have seen a huge percentage increase,”
suggests Hantec’s Sharpe.

### 'Proactive push'

However, while acknowledging that few if any brokers would have more
than 10% of their client base classified as professional clients, he
says the percentage would still have been influenced significantly by
the number of retail clients that have stopped trading or moved to an
offshore broker in search of higher leverage.

“We are certainly aware that a number of our competitors made a
proactive push to encourage clients to opt for professional status and
therefore have much larger numbers of clients that have done so,” says
Callan.

“We also understand that those firms are receiving a good deal of
scrutiny from regulators and may end up being required to reclassify
clients back to retail.”

In July, Esma said it would – along with NCAs – “continue to monitor
compliance of CFD providers with the product intervention decisions”.

A crackdown on EU-based providers moving clients to intra-group third
country organizations outside the scope of the [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s could be the
next battleground in this segment of the FX market.
