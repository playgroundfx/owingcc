Hugh Kimura is the founder of [www.tradingheroes.com][1] and strict
believer of self-education. He founded his [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) to document his
journey to become a full-time forex trader.



Hugh believes that when people are self-sufficient andÂ make more money
than they need, then they can focus on things that have meaning to them.
He publishes his trading record online so his audience can see the good
and bad and learn from his experience.
