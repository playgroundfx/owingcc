Hi Everyone! I know it's been awhile since my last podacast. I have been
away and as soon as I came home, I lost my voice. However, I am very
excited to share some [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) with you and hope you will listen to hear all
about it.

If you want to get the latest updates on my special announcement, go to
[www.10000trades.com][1] and leave your email address. I will provide
you with a very special gift to help tide you over until we launch.

In the meantime, you can also follow me on Youtube
(<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUC_JI68AAtcZQQbXF_-m1g>) and
Facebook (<https://www.facebook.com/TradingwithVenus/?fref=ts>) to get
the latest Forex updates and [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/).

We will go back to our regularly scheduled interview series later this
week and I look forward to you all joining me at
[www.10000trades.com][1] as well.

Have a great trading week!
