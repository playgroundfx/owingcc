Last look in the FX market is under scrutiny again.

In August, six non-bank [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s – Citadel Securities, Flow
Traders, HC Tech, Jump Trading, Virtu Financial and [XTX Markets][1] –
issued statements criticizing the practice.

This followed the publication of data on Risk.net indicating that one-
in-four of the top 50 [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s do not publicly disclose how
they use it.

Last look gives market makers a final opportunity to reject an order
after a client commits to trade at a quoted price. It has long been a
contentious practice, [drawing a fine for Barclays in 2015][2] and
[criticism from market participants even earlier][3], yet its continued
existence [points to the difficulty of agreeing a consistent market
approach][4].

Euromoney [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)ed the six [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s for comment, but only
Virtu responded.

The firm’s head FX trader, David Kratz, describes last look as a "blunt
and cheap solution" that is nonetheless effective at ensuring liquidity
streams are used for their intended purposes, protecting against
liquidity recycling, and normalizing for technological differences
between makers and takers that might cause delays in market data
delivery or order submission.

But while last look is a viable way to achieve technological balance, he
suggests there are better ones.

“For one, [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s and liquidity consumers should be aligned
on liquidity provision and expected behaviour. Once expectations are
clear, the provider and consumer should be using the best available
technology to ensure that only live, reliable market data is used for
trading.”

Vikas Srivastava, chief revenue officer at FX platform Integral, reckons
that last look has an important role when used for its legitimate
purpose of risk control, and that rather than distorting the FX market,
it can in fact make the market healthier by not forcing market makers to
be defensive in their pricing.

Speaking at the FX Week USA conference in July, UBS executive director
Blaise Sheppard suggested that removing last look would have a negative
impact on bid/offer spreads.

### Unintended consequences

If last look were to be completely removed it would likely have
unintended consequences, including the potential worsening of liquidity,
adds Integral's Srivastava. “This assumes last look is used for the
purpose for which it is intended [mitigating risk and off-market trades]
and not as a profit-making strategy.”

However, James Singleton, chairman and CEO of electronic FX platform
Cürex, is critical of the practice. He states that, no matter the
justification, last look is not a practice his buy-side institution
clients should accept since it exposes them to unlimited risk. Cürex
does not allow last look for its [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s.

“Our [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s appreciate the quality of our customers’ flows
and provide an aggregated book with very competitive spreads,” he adds.
“In that context, we do not agree that removing last look would have a
negative impact on bid/offer spreads because our experience does not
support it.”

Kratz cautions that viewing last-look liquidity alongside firm liquidity
misrepresents the depth, size and prices available in the market. This
stems from a misunderstanding of the basis upon which market makers
choose to provide liquidity at certain price points and sizes.

The most aggressive last-look quotes are made on the basis that they
aren’t subject to sweeping, so it doesn’t really make sense to consider
this liquidity alongside other last look or firm quotes (market makers
use last look to make sure that no one is sweeping out the market and
moving it against them).

Because of this, without an understanding of the engagement expectations
between [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/) and liquidity consumer, even making
comparisons between two last-look feeds can be misleading.

“Removing last look, or universally enforcing hold time, has the same
effect of transferring more risk to market makers,” says Kratz. “All
things being equal, market makers will reflect their increased risk in
the form of wider spreads and smaller sizes or by creating additional
fragmentation in the market in an attempt to segment trading
counterparties.

"This impacts liquidity consumers’ ability to perform meaningful
transaction cost analysis (TCA) and conduct best execution analysis.”

### Consumers' needs

One option for [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s and liquidity consumers is to engage
in dialogue to ensure the liquidity is configured to best meet the
consumers’ needs. In this scenario, the consumer of the liquidity should
be able to achieve better outcomes than from a one-size-fits-all
proposal.

“Whether market makers embrace zero hold time or adhere to the Global
Code’s prohibition of using client information within a no-last-look
window, we should not equate greater transparency with the higher goal
of Mifid II’s mandate of best execution,” says Singleton.

“The use of client trading information is a critical threat to best
execution outcomes and the elimination of last look is the only absolute
step to create a fully transparent and fair marketplace.”

According to New Change FX managing director Andrew Woolmer, the wider
issue is that there are plenty of large asset managers who are concerned
about abuse of last look but do not have the technology to capture
correct execution timestamps.

“Given that the last-look windows are 200 milliseconds long and we
regularly find asset managers who are unable to capture millisecond data
on their timestamps ‒ or indeed an accurate timestamp of any sort ‒ the
question of establishing abuse is rather fraught,” he says.

A further complicating factor is that some asset managers are still not
using independent data to perform their transaction cost analysis.

So while transparency around last look may be an important issue for
asset managers, it is also important to capture better data, use
independent data to validate execution costs and eventually demand that
execution is benchmarked at the point of execution.
