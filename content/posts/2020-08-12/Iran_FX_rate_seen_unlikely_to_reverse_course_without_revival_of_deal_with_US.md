Iran's official exchange rate as of July 17 was just over 42,000 rials
to the dollar. This rate, however, is subsidised by the Iranian
government and reserved for humanitarian imports.

Imports of other essential products use the Integrated Forex Deals
System, locally known as Nima, which gives a rate of around 154,000
rials.

The parallel or open-market rate is applied to all other exports and
used by local currency traders. According to Bonbast, a [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/) that has
tracked unofficial currency market rates in Iran since 2012, dollars
were selling for around 241,500 rials on July 17.

Fereydoun Khavand, a French-Iranian economist based in Paris, blames the
Central Bank of Iran (CBI) for failing to preserve the value of the
national currency, by printing money since the mid 2000s.

CBI governor Abdolnaser Hemmati recently stated that the bank had
injected $288 billion into the foreign-exchange market over the last 15
years to control the rate of exchange. Yet despite the apparent failure
of this strategy, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, has instructed the
central bank to continue the intervention.

### Dollar problem

Most of this US currency has come from oil sales and non-oil exports to
neighbouring countries such as Iraq, UAE and Turkey. The problem Iran
faces now is that a combination of [sanctions][1] and reduced demand for
oil since the coronavirus pandemic began mean it has fewer dollars at
its disposal.

“Many Iranian economists believe this approach has adversely impacted
Iranian exports and production,” says Arash Azarmi, economist at Volant
Media, which owns London-based Persian [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) channel Iran International.
“Countries weaken their currency to stimulate exports, but Iran has done
the opposite, which is a major reason why the economy and the rial are
deteriorating.”

Iran’s exports have fallen dramatically during the pandemic, but the
depreciation of the rial is more of a price correction, suggests Saeed
Ghasseminejad, senior Iran and financial economics adviser at the
Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

“Had Tehran allowed the exchange rate to be discovered through market
forces, we probably would not have seen the big spikes that we have
seen,” he says. “However, the central bank resists market forces and
defends the rial for as long as it can before at some point giving up,
leading to enormous market corrections.”

Another factor is that the dollar and euro have become commodities in
Iran, with ordinary people looking at foreign currency as an investment
opportunity, according to Bonbast spokesperson Ray Kazemi.

Kazemi tells Euromoney that the government’s efforts to keep the value
of the rial artificially high have only served to increase the import of
foreign goods, causing further foreign currency outflows.

### Changing balance

In mid June, the Tehran Times reported that the new parliament had
proposed strengthening economic diplomacy and changing the pattern of
oil and oil-products exports, to shift the country's foreign exchange
balance.

The new parliament may be offering schemes and policies to repair Iran’s
economy, but Azarmi at Volant cautions that this approach has been
unsuccessful for previous administrations.

“Iran’s economic diplomacy directly relates to its foreign diplomacy,”
he explains. “Many economists and political scientists propose that the
country has no option but to foster better global relations in order to
stimulate economic growth and benefit from foreign investment.

“However, many Iranian political programmes do not follow this
trajectory.”

Even the trade relationships Iran does have, such as with neighbouring
countries and with China, are under considerable strain due to the
Covid-19 crisis. According to recent media reports, Iran and China are
working on a pact to allow Chinese investment into many sectors of the
economy in return for oil supplies.

“Some Iranian politicians have stated that they should head back to the
East in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of foreign relations, which is the trail of thought that
lead to the recent deal with China,” adds Azarmi. “Despite this formal
agreement, the reality is that even China is accommodating the US
sanctions and many Chinese companies have left Iran because of this.
Therefore, it seems that such agreements are not worth the paper they
are written on.”

Kazemi is also sceptical about the value of such an approach, noting
that due to [the severe US sanctions][4] no country is willing to buy
Iran's oil, even it is a barter in the form of goods versus oil.

“Only China buys oil from Iran on a very limited basis, which is more
about addressing Iran’s past debts to China,” he says.

### Foreign [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)

Iran’s economy has been hostage to the Islamic Republic’s aggressive
foreign [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), says Ghasseminejad at FDD.

“Major, stable economic improvement will not materialise as long as
Tehran continues its revisionist foreign [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and support for
terrorism,” he says.

Garbis Iradian, the Institute of International Finance’s chief economist
for the Middle East and North Africa, suggests that most of the
depreciation of the parallel market exchange rate from 64,000 rials to
the dollar in June 2018 is due to the re-imposition of US sanctions.

However, he also accepts that economic diplomacy and changes to oil and
oil-products exports alone will do little to boost Iran’s access to
dollars.

Despite the likely continued scarcity of US currency, Azarmi says it is
possible the government and central bank will try to limit demand again
while simultaneously making the rial artificially stronger.

“If these policies are enacted, we may see an artificial calmness in the
market,” he adds. “However, this is unsustainable, and economic reality
will soon reappear in what seems like a tragic cycle.”

Kazemi says the effective value of the rial will continue to fall and
that the only possible hope for Iran is a change of administration in
the White House.

“Iran needs to [negotiate with the US][6] and make concessions in its
foreign [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/),” he concludes. “President Donald Trump has signalled his
willingness to discuss a new deal with Iran, but the Iranian leadership
has vehemently rejected any new negotiations.

“Iran will be hoping that Joe Biden is elected in November, as the
nuclear deal was Obama’s and Biden's legacy, and Biden as president
would most probably try to revive it.”
