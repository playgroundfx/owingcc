At the age of 21, Warrior Protocol Founder & Lead Coach Simon Smart
turned his back on his legal career to move to Japan and focus on his
study of old world martial arts. A journey that ultimately led him
through years of training in meditation, body-mind integration and
warriorship. After years of training soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan
Simon and his wife moved back to the United States in 2008. After years
working with violent crime and sex crime victims, this led to a focus on
sales, marketing, consulting and winning awards in the corporate world.

Simon now offers training through his [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/),
[www.WarriorProtocol.com][1] where he uses all his previous experience
to help the modern male entrepreneur 10x their business performance.
