The latest survey carried out by the Bank of England’s (BoE) foreign
exchange joint standing committee appears to confirm the view that
trading in sterling does badly in conditions of widespread stress.

Data gathered from 27 financial institutions in the UK for the April
2020 survey shows that while there was a decline in average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
turnover for all the major currency pairs compared with the findings of
the previous survey in October 2019, sterling trading fell particularly
sharply, with USD/GBP and EUR/GBP down by 32% and 31% respectively.

The previous survey reported that USD/GBP was the second most-traded
currency pair after USD/EUR, with a gap of almost $5 billion a day to
USD/JPY. However, according to the new data, [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) USD/JPY trading
exceeded that of USD/GBP by almost $27 billion in April.

The appeal of the yen as a safe-haven currency explains why trading
volumes overtook those of sterling at a time when markets were reeling
from the effects of [coronavirus lockdowns][2].

“The pound is among the least defensive currencies in the G10 and
[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s typically avoid it during periods of stress and high
volatility,” explains Kenneth Broux, head of corporate research FX and
rates at Societe Generale.

Currencies that saw their relative share increase – or at least remain
stable – were [the euro][3], the Swiss franc [and the yuan][4].

“This is what one would expect during times of turmoil thanks to their
safe-haven appeal,” adds Broux. “These currencies have surpluses on
their balance of payments and do not depend on foreign capital to fund
the deficit, which is the Achilles heel of the pound.”

Rajesh Venkataramani, a partner at Goldman Sachs, says at least some of
the fall in sterling trading compared with previous periods can also be
attributed to volumes having been elevated when markets reacted to UK
prime minister Boris Johnson’s election as leader of the governing
Conservative Party last year, raising the [likelihood of the UK leaving
the European Union without striking an exit deal][6].

“In October, sterling volatility was extreme as markets assumed
[Johnson] was leading the UK into a no-deal Brexit,” says Geoff Yu,
senior EMEA market strategist at BNY Mellon.

Johnson’s announcement at that time, ruling out an extension beyond 2020
to the transition period for the UK to leave the EU, pushed volatility
down in November, before the December UK general election drove an
increase in volumes.

In [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of instruments, FX swaps and currency swaps were hardest hit,
with the former down by a fifth between October and April, and average
currency swap volumes falling 37%.

### Financial stress

Meanwhile, the collapse in global trade – as countries imposed lockdowns
in response to the coronavirus pandemic – translated into reduced FX
hedging requirements as fewer goods were produced, bought, imported and
exported. Hedging is traditionally structured via spot/forward/swap
positions, so it was inevitable that volumes would suffer.

Another factor was financial stress.

“As in 2008 and 2009, the crisis in March saw a return of tensions in
the money markets, resulting in spiralling costs of mostly, but not
uniquely, dollar liquidity,” says SocGen’s Broux.

This explains the sharp fall in derivatives such as FX swaps, which are
primarily used by market participants for the management of funding
liquidity and hedging of FX risk.

Some market participants have previously suggested there is a trend
towards the use of [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) rather than swaps. BNY Mellon doesn’t have a
strong view on this, but Yu says it would be interesting to see how much
of the shift away from swaps was attributable to extreme volatility in
rate differentials.

“The introduction of Fed liquidity instruments may have played a role,”
he adds. “In such an environment, using [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) rather than rate-related
derivatives to hedge currency risk does seem more appropriate.

“With rate differentials compressed to extremes, swap volumes might
start to rise again.”

### 'Swift decline'

The other notable finding from the survey was that average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/)
reported UK FX turnover in April was 16% lower than in October.
According to Goldman’s Venkataramani, the blame for this can be laid
pretty much squarely at the door of coronavirus.

“Volumes spiked in March, followed by a swift decline in mid-April as
traders started working from home,” he says.

“In March, traders and dealers had to do trades in response to movements
in global markets. Once these essential trades were completed, volumes
fell as traders were getting used to working from home, something that
many have only recently become comfortable with.”

Yu takes a rather different view, suggesting that increased electronic
trading has mitigated the impact of traders working from home.

“Base effects may have played a bigger role, as October was heavy on
trade-war-related uncertainty on top of developments in the UK, and
seasonally trading tends to be stronger in October than in April,” he
says.
