Big global banks still dominate FX trading in Asia, according to the
[latest results from the annual survey][2] of the industry carried out
by Asiamoney’s sister publication Euromoney.

JPMorgan beats Bank of America Merrill Lynch to the overall top spot in
Asia, with UBS, Citi and Deutsche rounding out the top five. At a
country level, Malaysia’s CIMB is the only local bank to top the overall
[ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) in its domestic market. In all other markets the hegemony of the
international bank persists.

Whether you’re a big global player or a local trading shop, you face the
same problem today: [markets are in flux][3]. It’s not just commodities,
bonds and stocks responding to cuts in interest rates but currencies
too.

“There are lots of idiosyncratic stories going on in [Asia] that make it
a very exciting time to be trading FX,” says Geoff Kot, global head of
FX trading at Standard Chartered.

The [latest phase of the trade war][4] began in the first week of August
with a tweet from US president Donald Trump threatening additional
tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods. This created volatility in the
market and with it an increase in client activity, as well as responses
from other countries and central banks.

India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand [cut interest rates][5]
in August in response either to slowing growth or the expectation of a
slowdown.

“The reaction [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) of various major central banks around the world
are very fascinating,” says Kot. “I expect that to continue to be the
theme for the coming quarter.”

### Caution

For [[investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in the Asia FX market][6], that means making new risk
management assumptions and keeping an eye on market movements.

“It’s quite a technical environment that we’re operating in at the
moment,” says Tony Shaw, head of institutional and wealth sales for
global markets at HSBC Asia Pacific.

He cautions that [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s need to differentiate between headline [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)
and actual risks. While the moving market creates an environment for
reactionary trading, [now is the time to be strategic][8], he says.

“The discussions have morphed from ‘what’s going on?’ to a far more
cerebral dialogue about risk management.”

Chu Kok Wei, group head of treasury and markets at CIMB, agrees that
more attention is being paid to underlying policies and market changes
that may have long-term effects, rather than the market’s quick
reactions to Trump’s tweets.

“People are either slowly getting used to it, or the right word is
getting tired and lethargic of it,” he says. “Over time, people will
probably pay less attention to headline reactions.”

On August 5, just days after Trump’s tariff threats, [the renminbi][9]
weakened, falling through the symbolic rate of seven to the dollar,
shocking [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s.

“It’s quite clear, in both action and communication, that this was
driven by the escalation of tariffs,” says Adarsh Sinha, Bank of
America’s co-head of Asia rates and FX strategy. “We have gone through
seven [renminbi to the dollar]. There’s no longer a line in the sand.”

The move, says Sinha, was a surprise, particularly after US treasury
secretary Steven Mnuchin’s visit to Shanghai at the end of July.

“It was clear that as long as there was some hope and scope for
resolution… that [China] would try and prevent a depreciation of the
renminbi,” says Sinha. “But the additional tariff announcement by Trump
showed that there had been a loss of good faith.”

He makes the [point that China][10] “stopped manipulating the currency,”
and adds that “they were manipulating it to keep it below seven.”

### 'Currency manipulator'

Following the renminbi’s fall, the US-China trade row seemed to escalate
further when the US Treasury Department almost immediately designated
China as a ‘currency manipulator’. But the label itself carries little
meaning at this point, bankers agree. Generally, labelling a country a
currency manipulator would be followed by negotiations, the possibility
of tariffs and related trade threats – things that came before the label
was used.

“It’s not particularly relevant,” says Sinha, calling the label merely
symbolic. “The currency manipulator tag doesn’t really matter.”

But the willingness of the US to bandy about the term like a weapon
should raise a few eyebrows.

The US has three factors – a global current account surplus, a large
bilateral trade surplus and persistent one-way intervention in foreign
exchange markets – for identifying currency manipulation by its trading
partners. Notably, China did not check all of the boxes of these
criteria.

“It shows that the US can, of course, label someone a manipulator,” says
Kot. “But it also shows that they don’t have to meet all three published
criteria for the Treasury to label someone a currency manipulator.”

“It is probably more of a negotiation technique by the US,” says Henry
Quek, Asia Pacific head of FX sales, trading and research at State
Street Global Markets. “The question is whether the US is going to use
this technique as a negotiation strategy with other currencies as well.”
