CFaR measures the extent to which future cash flows may fall short of
expectations as a consequence of changes in market variables, while EaR
assesses the amount that net income may change due to a change in FX
rates over a specified period.

It is a challenge to move away from an accepted practice, but treasurers
cannot ignore the mounting headlines about public companies losing
earnings or revenue due to FX rate movements, says Mark Lewis, corporate
treasury product manager at Bloomberg.

"We need to accept that the current model – the percentage hedging
approach – does not work, and switch to the CFaR/EaR model that ensures
all risks are reported correctly,” he says.

In fact, one in three of the corporate treasurers, financial analysts
and risk managers surveyed by Bloomberg during a webinar on corporate
risk management said they were already using CFaR and a further 29% were
considering using it.

But, when asked what obstacles stood in the way of adopting a CFaR-based
hedging [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), two thirds of respondents cited the difficulties of
explaining the [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) internally and to the board.

### Limited resources

In some cases, senior management have limited [historical](https://www.fintechee.com/services/historical-data-for-forex/) practitioner
experience with CFaR and other risk modelling techniques.

Additionally, corporates often do not have the technological capability
or staffing expertise to model risk on a regularly scheduled basis – and
for those that do, the function is generally managed by a limited number
of employees.

“[Risk modelling][2] is often an area of the organization that, while
strategically important, has a lower profile within the larger finance
and treasury structure," says Andrew Bateman, EVP of capital markets
buyside at financial services technology firm FIS.

At-risk concepts were originally developed to quantify risk at financial
institutions, where managing risk portfolios is the core business. As a
result these institutions benefit much more from advanced quantification
techniques and have invested heavily in their risk management
departments.

For many corporate treasuries, however, risk management is not the
primary business.

Value-at-risk techniques took some time to gain acceptance even in the
banking sphere, and it can be difficult to explain statistical
[simulation](https://www.fintechee.com/features/trading-simulation/)-based approaches to board-level members without a
quantitative background, observes Sean Coyne, principal solution
consultant risk and quant at financial technology firm Finastra.

At an organizational level, EaR demands a centralized risk management
function and is best suited to multinational corporations that can
derive benefit from diversified exposures where correlations offset
risks.

“Smaller corporates exposed to a single commodity or FX risk will see
less advantage from EaR, which requires sophisticated models and is
typically beyond the capability of the corporate treasury to build out
in-house,” adds Coyne.

“However, [CFaR and EaR map directly to the KPIs][4] of the board and in
time will gain traction.”

[CFaR and EaR models are most relevant for large corporations][5] with
significant exposure in multiple currencies and complex intercompany
structures, where both liquidity and earnings risk at the consolidated
level matter.

That is the view of Philippe Gelis, CEO of currency risk management
solutions provider Kantox, who accepts that this type of complex hedging
model may not be suitable for all companies. “It will depend on their
risk objectives, on the number of currencies they use, and on other
factors specific to each company,” he says.

Gelis suggests that to have a meaningful risk discussion, CFOs and
treasurers need to avoid technicalities and focus on the strategic
aspects of FX risk management. “In the end, what senior management is
really interested in is minimizing [the impact of FX volatility][6] on
their business.”

### Technological conservatism

More than 40% of the Bloomberg survey respondents said their company was
reluctant to change its current systems.

When asked what vendors could do to overcome this reluctance to invest
in new technology, Henning von Tresckow, managing director of Trinity
Treasury Management Systems, recommends making the digital
transformation as easy as possible, with cloud treasury solutions that
can be used end-to-end or plugged into an existing workflow, including
APIs and interfaces to widely used ERP software.

According to Gelis, solutions providers must focus on two key aspects,
neither of which directly relate to cash flow at risk. Firstly, vendors
should guarantee robust and easy connectivity with all internal systems
(TMS/ERP) in order to improve data quality.

Secondly, these complex projects should be implemented in stages,
starting with the automation of hedging execution, as it usually has a
very high return on investment and can be considered a quick win.

Sander van Tol, partner at treasury, risk and corporate finance
consultancy Zanders, says that although technology can assist in making
the required calculations, the most important requirements for adopting
a cash flow at risk-based hedging [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) are an advanced understanding
of at risk techniques, willingness at board level to change the hedging
[policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) and an understanding of the underlying financial exposures.

The last of these points is the real problem – many corporates still do
not have full visibility on their FX exposures, van Tol concludes. “In
order to have meaningful CFaR numbers, one should understand the
relationship between the financial variable – for example, the FX rate –
and the related cash flow.”
