Casey Stubbs learned about trading while he was trying to teach his
father to use a computer. As a self-professed computer geek, Forex
trading caught his eye because the digital aspect made it that much
easier to trade frequently and easily.Â Casey founded Winners Edge
Trading as a small blog and has since grown it into one of the premier
educational resources for Forex traders. He has helped thousands edge
their way into the Forex market and is sharing his story and journey
with us on Trading With Venus.
