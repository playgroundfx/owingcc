### Best Service

 **Best Service Ranking explained:**

Our Best Service Awards are based on Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
feedback gathered in our survey. The [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s we generate are determined
by the value that respondents place on the services offered by their
providers (they can select: Not important – Somewhat important – Very
important – Essential – N/A).

  

Later in the survey, after a respondent designates his/her
counterparties, we ask how well those counterparties deliver these
services (they can select: Unsatisfactory – Improvement needed – Meets
expectations – Exceeds expectations – Exceptional – N/A).

  

Our standard Customer Satisfaction [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) is to take the services a
respondent has designated Very Important and Essential and then look at
how each counterparty has performed. We measure the performance as a net
score by adding the percentage of “exceeds expectations” and
“exceptional” responses and then subtracting the percentage of
“unsatisfactory” and “improvement needed” responses. It gives us a net
percentage score for each counterparty that shows how good they are at
delivering on the services their customers rank as important. This is
also depicted in

[table format here][7]
