Episode 64: Do You Have Trader A.D.D?

When I work with traders who question why they aren’t becoming
profitable one of the common issues is their trade strategy. I notice
that they are always on the lookout for the “holy grail” strategy that
will bring them consistent profits. However, in constantly looking for
the “holy grail strategy” they jump around from one strategy to the next
before giving any one strategy a chance to work. Today, I will help you
identify if you have “Trader A.D.D.” and [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) overcome it.

If you want to see different strategies in action and how to stick to
one strategy, I suggest you join me in the Turning Pro Challenge.
