This is one of the most common questions I receive from traders starting
their journey. How to take their account of $X to $XXX in X amount of
time. However, so often the expectations are out of line with reality
and can be the start of a very risky trading journey.

and what you need to do every day to put yourself in the best position
to scale your account.
