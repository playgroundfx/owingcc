Hedging decisions usually boil down to a choice between [[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/)][2] and
[forwards][3].

In the past, many treasurers would have automatically opted for the
latter, where cash flows were certain – or at least highly probable –
but there are a number of scenarios in which this assumption can be
flawed.

Firstly, the [corporate’s business may be correlated to the foreign
currency being hedged][4], which is typically the case in [emerging
markets][5]. If a company selling goods in Russia and hedging expected
sales in RUB hit trouble, sales volumes would fall and the [company
could find itself over-hedged][6].

The hedging of an acquisition is not straightforward either. Even after
shareholders agree to a deal, there may be regulatory approvals to
obtain, which means a UK-based corporate paying for the acquired company
in USD would be exposed to the risk of the [dollar appreciating][7].

“In this scenario, hedging with a forward would be risky as the timing
of the transaction is uncertain,” says Romain Camus, head of exotic
[options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) at Digital Vega.

“If the regulators did not approve the transaction, the company would be
left with a forward without having the underlying economic exposure and
could be exposed to significant losses.”

Another situation in which an option is a better product for hedging FX
risk is when a company is involved in a large tender process where it
has to provide a quote, but is uncertain about whether it will win the
tender.

Costs and margin can be protected by entering into FX [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) without
the obligation of settling any FX transaction if the tender is lost.

Even if a corporate hedges a currency exposure that is certain, a
forward may not be the most appropriate instrument. The hedging rate may
not be attractive, for example if a corporate hedges foreign revenues in
a currency that is close to historic lows.

A further factor working in favour of [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) is reduced [volatility
among the major currencies][8]. This trend is reflected in the JPMorgan
volatility index, which tracks the currencies of the G7 economies and
touched its lowest level since 1992 earlier this year.

“Lower volatility implies lower [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) premiums, which are beneficial
for buyers,” says Paul Houston, executive director and global head of FX
at CME Group.

“However, corporates need to be aware that the spreads of buying and
selling [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) tend to remain constant and are therefore proportionally
larger at lower volatility.”

Fortunately, there are mechanisms treasurers can use to reduce the cost
of the premium charged when purchasing an option to cover the transfer
of risk, for example selling [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) to net off against the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) they
are buying.

Options can thereby be combined to create a variety of risk/reward
profiles to suit specific exposures, whereas forwards tend to fix the
hedge rate to a specific date and create a linear risk/reward strategy
with little flexibility.

### Strike rate

Corporates looking to lower their [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) costs could also [set a strike
rate][10] that is far away from the current market rate and would
typically be the worst possible rate the company was comfortable with,
says David Moya, a senior manager at treasury management consultancy
Zanders who focuses on corporate clients.

The strike rate is the price at which the holder of an option can buy or
sell the underlying security when the option is exercised.

“Selling another option to offset – totally or partially – the premium
cost would give protection to the company on the downside while allowing
it to participate in the upside potential until the strike rate of the
written option,” he says.

“However, this strategy would not be advisable in situations where cash
flows are uncertain.”

The extent to which corporates are prepared to add optionality into
their hedging programmes usually comes down to the same factors,
suggests Pritesh Ruparel, head of [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) at Sucden Financial.

“These considerations include the level of comfort a treasurer has with
trading [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/); the systems architecture of the treasury desk to help
them manage and assess the hedging programme; and the availability of
good data so that they can assess pricing from their liquidity
providers,” he says.

Options are more complex to understand, risk-manage, track and account
for than forwards, but corporates are becoming more knowledgeable and
comfortable with them, adds Camus at Digital Vega.

“Digitalization of [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) flow has provided transparency and this is
certainly contributing to the increase in volumes,” he concludes.
