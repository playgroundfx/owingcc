FX trading [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/) are getting smarter at dealing with crises – and
getting more popular as a result.

A few weeks is a long time in a volatile foreign exchange market.

At the end of March, Greenwich Associates published a report entitled
'Digitization delayed: why algos aren’t more popular in FX', based on
data collected before markets felt the impact of [Covid-19][3].

It found that only 37% of FX market participants surveyed used
[algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/) – and just 22% of their volume was traded algorithmically.

Fast forward to late April, and JPMorgan’s FX e-commerce team was
telling clients of a big increase in volumes of algos for tickets with a
notional value above $10 million, with 60% of these orders traded
algorithmically in March.

Buy-side traders working largely from home while coping with a
significant increase in the number of trades to execute have turned to
algos so they can focus on more time-consuming, less liquid and complex
trades.

Jill Sigelbaum, head of FXall, notes that algo trading volumes on that
platform increased by 380% in March compared to the same period last
year, with the bulk of the increase attributable to asset management
clients.

“We were told by some of our clients that with the challenges in trading
from home with less desktop real estate, they were appreciating one-
screen [meaning one-system] access to multiple algos across multiple
banks, as clients had to restrict the number of applications they had
open at any one time due to corporate VPN restrictions on bandwidth,”
she says.

### Increased familiarity

According to Ralf Donner, head of FICC execution solutions at Goldman
Sachs, client demand for execution in larger sizes than usual is another
factor behind recent growth in algo usage.

“Large algos had been tried and tested in calmer markets and were given
the benefit of the doubt in the more volatile period,” he says.

Increased familiarity with the technology is also a consideration.
Compared to previous periods of high volatility (such as the EU
referendum and the 2017 US presidential election, for example) clients
now have a better understanding of how algos work.

In addition, the volatility in March was over a sustained period rather
than a singular shock or focused on a specific date, explains Scott
Wacker, head of FICC e-commerce sales and marketing at JPMorgan.
“Clients therefore had time to observe and change their approach,” he
says.

The perception that algos don’t perform well in volatile markets is
largely derived from the experience of flash scenarios, where spot moves
dramatically and algos trigger their circuit breakers. However, Pete
Eggleston, CEO of BestX, says his firm’s research indicates that not all
algo styles are unsuited to more volatile markets.

“Using arrival price as a benchmark, our analysis shows that ‘get done’
algo styles [the most aggressive algorithmic order type] improved their
performance in the first quarter of this year compared to Q4 2019,” he
says.

FX markets have been mostly well-behaved during the crisis so far,
despite wider spreads and greater volatility. The main challenge for
algo execution, therefore, has been to re-route orders automatically to
the available sources of liquidity – among which internal matching was
very important – and to minimize the parameters governing execution.

“Perhaps it wasn't the ‘fire and forget’ approach that algos had become
for many clients pre-crisis, but execution outcomes compared to typical
benchmarks were still roughly normally distributed – albeit with a wider
standard deviation,” adds Donner.

### Adaptive algos

That might be partly down to greater use of adaptive algos. Asif Razaq,
global head of FX algorithmic execution at BNP Paribas, says adaptive
algos can adjust their [execution behaviour][7] to fit the market,
becoming more or less active and [chasing pockets of liquidity][8].

He says that clients not only save on the spread quoted by their banks
on a risk transfer basis, they are also able to capture that spread
through an algo by posting interest into the market.

“When spreads are several times their normal values this can add up to a
considerable cost saving,” he says.

A review of emerging themes and challenges in algorithmic trading
published in April by the FICC Markets Standards Board observed that use
of execution [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/) in FX was underpinned by an increasingly
fragmented market structure where liquidity can disappear quickly.

Some think the trend for greater use of [algorithms](https://www.fintechee.com/algorithms-for-trading/) will outlive the
coronavirus volatility, as traders will continue to value the
attractions of lower spread.

“If they have reached the conclusion that that is a good thing to do in
volatile conditions, they are likely to reach the same conclusion in
quieter periods,” says MahiFX CEO David Cooney.
