Exchanges have been busy bolting on new acquisitions during the past 18
months.

Shareholders of the [London Stock Exchange (LSE)][1] have approved its
deal to purchase Refinitiv, a financial data business that was carved
out of Thomson Reuters and bought by Blackstone in 2018.

Deutsche Börse, meanwhile, has acquired GTX, an FX electronic
communications network (ECN), while CME Group has [bought NEX][2], which
included the EBS trading platform.

The moves appear sensible. Each of the exchange operators has
opportunities to provide trading, clearing, processing, data and
analytics tools to both pure FX traders and traders who are hedging
against securities or derivatives.

“The merger between LSE and Refinitiv should be a powerful package as it
brings together the data expertise of Refinitiv with the trading
experience of the LSE to create a services provider to banks and brokers
offering a platform for trading shares, currencies, bonds and
derivatives,” says Henry Wilkes, head of foreign exchange at Point
Group, a consultancy firm.

Exchanges are now highly electronic marketplaces, so investment in
electronic FX trading platforms is a logical move.

This is particularly important because of increased regulatory
oversight, such as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
guidelines in Europe, which have increased compliance costs and squeezed
exchange operating margins, according to Jason Hughes, global head of
sales at ADSS, a multi-asset trading company.

However, data from the 2019 survey by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) indicate that average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volumes for the primary FX
venues have fallen during the past three years – during which time spot
FX volume rose by more than 20%.

### Factors

Some of the factors behind this decline include the [main liquidity
providers losing control over liquidity][4] as their pricing is recycled
to secondary and tertiary venues.

Alongside that is lower volatility and an increase in internalization by
[liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s, as well as the rise of the non-bank market-maker
with connectivity across the market.

According to LMAX Exchange Group CEO David Mercer, this lack of growth
highlights the difficulties of running an efficient and profitable
business with a purely transactional model that serves the institutional
market – which already benefits from some of the lowest transaction fees
in capital markets.

“It is natural for transaction fee or commission-only models to be
challenged in low-volatility environments, which we have seen for much
of 2019,” he says. “The exchange groups that have purchased FX trading
venues need to expand the footprint of their new acquisitions to add
significant corporate value.”

This has encouraged exchanges to consider the peripheral services
offered by over-the-counter (OTC) venues and to look at whether to
impose minimum brokerage fees.

However, Mercer suggests the low value of market data based on last-look
prices explains why some recent [FX platform acquisitions][6] have
failed to generate revenues from their market data offerings.

“If you operate only in the bank space or the high-frequency trading
space, it is hard to have a viable business model – particularly in low-
volatility environments,” he says. “So, first of all you have to be able
to access all segments of the market and then have some part of your
business that is recurring.

“In the large exchange world, this is market data.”

### Options

Options for generating additional revenue include increasing market data
charges. However, accurate and timely FX market data is tightly held by
banks and non-banks that pay handsomely for the privilege, and it
remains to be seen whether they have the appetite for even higher fees.

[Euromoney has previously reported][7] how FX [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not want
liquidity to become fragmented as has happened in other markets, but
they also want more choice in how they trade and with whom.

_Noel Singh,

Noel Singh, head of eFX business development at derivatives broker
Sucden Financial, says exchanges are addressing these apparently
conflicting demands in some cases by trying to create ‘FX supermarkets’,
where clients can choose to trade a variety of products in different
ways.

“For instance, clients may trade exchange-traded FX contracts or use an
OTC spot FX central limit order book, or when trading longer-dated OTC
FX contracts they may choose to use a disclosed multi-provider venue,”
he says. “Exchanges seem to be trying to be all things to all users.”

On the basis that there are only a few genuine [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s in
the market, the buy side will find it more difficult to justify the cost
of connecting to venues that simply provide recycled liquidity.

“If the exchanges can tap into this trend and bolster the importance and
role of their primary venues, it will undermine the relevance of public
ECNs, where more than half of the traded volume is likely to be based on
recycled liquidity,” says Point Group's Wilkes.
