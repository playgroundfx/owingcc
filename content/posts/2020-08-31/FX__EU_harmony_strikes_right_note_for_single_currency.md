By the time European Union leaders announced on July 21 that they had
agreed a €750 billion package to help member states recover from the
[impact of coronavirus][2], EUR/USD had risen to 1.1475 from 1.1176 just
a month earlier.

Expectations of 1.15 on the day were stymied by the composition of the
package, specifically that almost half its total value is in the form of
loans rather than grants.

But the euro has continued to rise, with the market viewing the deal as
evidence that the European Central Bank backstop is intact and [that the
risk][3] of European break-up remains low.

According to Deutsche Bank strategist George Saravelos, the euro-higher
trade over the coming months is all about whether or not European growth
outperforms that of the US. With indicators such as restaurant visits
suggesting that this divergence is accelerating, Deutsche remains
bullish, targeting 1.20.

Jari Stehn, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs, describes the
agreement on the [recovery fund][5] as an important political signal
that further European integration is possible. He expects EUR/USD to
strengthen to 1.25 over the next 12 months.

### Euro vs dollar

The ability of the EU to secure a deal compares favourably with the
situation in the US Senate, where Republicans and Democrats have been
unable to agree on the make-up of the latest fiscal stimulus package.

“We have seen the euro emerge as one of the go-to safe-haven
currencies,” says Societe Generale’s head of corporate research, FX and
rates, Kenneth Broux. “More [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s now want to own the euro in their
portfolios, although it must be stressed that dollar weakness has also
contributed to a higher EUR/USD.”

He adds that by coordinating the response of the 27 member states via
the common EU budget between 2021 and 2027, the European deal removes
the asymmetric downside risk for the single currency.

“The recovery fund effectively complements the whatever-is-necessary
rhetoric of the ECB and will stop [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s betting against the
reversibility of the euro,” says Broux. “The dollar has long been
expensive in valuation [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/). We don’t know what will happen in the case
of a second wave, and a return of corporate demand for dollar liquidity
may deflate EUR/USD, but I believe EUR/USD could be on course for a
return towards 1.20.”

Sam Lynton-Brown, head of G10 FX strategy Europe at BNP Paribas Markets
360, says that agreement on the recovery fund reduces the downside tail
in Europe, in turn enabling the euro to participate in broad dollar
weakness.

“Eurozone [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s (along with Japanese [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s) have the largest
exposure in USD assets,” he says. “Each currency remains significantly
cheap versus long-term equilibrium, implying plenty of scope for EUR
(and JPY) to rise and catch up with higher beta currencies.”

Lynton-Brown describes the size of the fund, the division between grants
and loans, governance on grant distribution, the degree of burden
sharing and the loan [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) as encouraging, and observes that his bank is
also bullish and positioned long EUR/USD.

“We see scope for EUR/USD gains to become more volatile, and therefore
think being long both spot and vol is attractive,” he says.

### ‘Hamiltonian moment’

The European recovery fund has been described as the EU’s ‘Hamiltonian
moment’, in reference to the decision of the US federal government to
assume all the debt incurred by states during the war of independence
under the direction of the country’s first treasury secretary, Alexander
Hamilton.

Although reluctant to go quite that far, BNY Mellon Markets senior EMEA
market strategist Geoff Yu says the willingness of Germany to recognise
the need for common resources to invest in Europe is potentially an
important step towards future [optimization](https://www.fintechee.com/features/genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) of the currency union.

“We expect the euro to drift higher over the next few months as its
Covid-19 response and recovery stands to outperform that of the US,” he
continues. “Even though it will take time for the results to come
through, the direction of travel – coupled with material underweighting
of Europe in global asset allocation – is positive for the currency.”

However, Yu also cautions against pushing the euro too much too quickly
as it could further eat into eurozone inflation, which is already
running at very low levels.

“Evidence of imported disinflation from a strong euro would immediately
generate a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) response,” he concludes.
