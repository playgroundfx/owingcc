Since the global financial crisis, most FX markets have enjoyed a decade
of extremely low volatility. While there have been initiatives around
regulatory compliance, the market has otherwise been quiet, with
volatility touching all-time lows as recently as January, exacerbated by
a depressed yield curve.

Clients simply had less need to trade in that kind of environment,
explains Jason Vitale, global head of FX at BNY Mellon Markets.

“There will always be commercial and payment flows in the spot market,
but FX as an asset class, or directional hedging activity, had been
depressed since the middle of last year in particular.”

Now it's different. Equity markets have been left reeling from big sell-
offs since the end of January, but FX volumes have rocketed.

Integral reported a 40% increase in average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volumes in March
(driven mainly by euro trading); FX spot volumes on CLS jumped 24% in
February; and CME Group’s FX average [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) volume reached its highest
ever level.

Before January there had been some debate among banks as to whether the
benign market was a cyclical or structural trend, but everything changed
once details of the coronavirus emerged.

Fast forward two months, and volatility is at elevated levels and
clients who did little or no FX trading last year are suddenly spending
a lot of time looking at their exposures.

### Effective response

Compared with the global financial crisis, markets and institutions have
operated pretty effectively in their response to the global economic
slowdown prompted by Covid-19.

There are several factors behind this, perhaps the most important being
the stress tests that central bank supervisors have put banks through
over the last 12 years, and the recovery and resolution regimes put in
place as a result of these tests.

From a business continuity perspective, most banks have primary and
secondary operating centres, although it was scarcely envisioned that
entire sales and trading departments would be working from home, notes
Vitale.

“Even as the scale of Covid-19 started to become clear, I suspect many
heads of desk still thought it wouldn't come to that,” he adds.

Simon Manwaring, head of currencies trading at NatWest Markets, reckons
that since most heads of trading had been through the global financial
crisis, they had a good idea of how the markets would react to the
pandemic, even if the events now took place over a much shorter
timescale than in 2008.

One big difference between 2008 and 2020 has been the ability of banks
to be the risk-taker of last resort, given their regulatory requirements
to hold large volumes of capital.

“Despite regulators taking swift and significant action, there was a
sense initially that [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)makers were behind the curve,” says
Manwaring. “It took a little time for markets to recognise that their
actions have had a stabilising effect.”

Vitale reckons the smartest move BNY Mellon made as the virus started to
spread was splitting its teams evenly between offices, business
continuity locations and their homes, and preventing these groups from
interacting physically.

“We also ensured those working remotely had the hardware they needed. As
of today, almost all our trading is being done from home,” he adds. “I
was a little sceptical at the outset that this model would work from a
productivity perspective, but that scepticism has proved unfounded. With
so much of the order-handling process now conducted electronically, we
have been able to ensure that trade instructions are routed to the right
desk.”

### Liquidity challenge

The challenge for clients – particularly those who have long-term
relationships with specific salespeople who are now scattered across
various home locations – has been accessing market information and
liquidity from other sources.

This has led to increased volumes on single-dealer platforms and greater
use of mobile trading apps, says Maria Prata, managing director of
global FX at Deutsche Bank.

Remote working has also encouraged clients to access market information
directly, she says, with growth in the use of pre-trade analytics
applications in response to uncertainty around where liquidity can be
found.

“Because liquidity has been constrained across markets, some providers
changed their [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) around benchmark orders with regard to fees or
submission times,” says Prata. “We haven’t done that, but understand
that others did.”

To mitigate the impact of the dispersal of teams and to allow them to
share insights on flows, Deutsche Bank has organised [daily](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/03/forex-trading-daily-strategy/) team
conference calls and video rooms to ensure that these teams are in
[contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/) and speaking throughout the day.

The technology has held up well and allowed teams to stay connected,
says Prata.

“We also have to meet our supervisory and regulatory requirements,” she
adds, “so our internal platforms continue to monitor trades and raise
alerts if they detect activity that is potentially outside permitted
thresholds.”

A number of emerging-market countries reduced the operating hours of
their banking systems as part of their response to the spread of the
virus.

“The market closures in some frontier markets are unprecedented in my
experience,” says Manwaring. “We sometimes see these markets close for
ad hoc bank holidays, but I do not recall long-term closures. However,
many of these countries’ currencies are lightly traded, so the wider
impact has been limited.”

### More to do

While heads of FX trading express some surprise at how well the move to
home working has gone in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of 'keeping the lights on', there is an
acknowledgement that managing client relationships in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of meetings
and engagement and fixing problems as a group presents a challenge for
this model of work.

“Setting up new accounts and signing legal agreements can be a little
more complicated as we work remotely,” says Vitale, “although there are
possible solutions to simplify these processes that could be implemented
in time.

“Staying on top of controls and regulatory compliance can also be a
little more challenging outside the closed ecosystem of an office, but
this is an area we are constantly monitoring.”

Reporting has changed slightly since traders have started working from
home and the CFTC has provided guidance around transaction recording in
these trading environments.

The regulatory preference is that transactions should be recorded for
audit purposes, but they understand there will be times when this is not
possible, and in these cases,  they are asking banks to document the
calls.

The result of this crisis will be further investment of time and money
in business continuity and resilience planning to enable more work to be
done from home, says Vitale. The ability for staff to work remotely will
become a requirement for critical [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) in future, he adds.

Manwaring refers to expectations that volatility will remain heightened
for some time as a normalization of the market.

“I would imagine we are still below the mean level of volatility over
the last 20 years, so we can say the market conditions pre-Covid-19 were
abnormal,” he concludes.
