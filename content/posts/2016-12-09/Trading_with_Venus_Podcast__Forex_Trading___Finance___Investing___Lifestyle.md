Mike Hamilton started his career in the insurance industry and within a
year had the Lloyd's ticket and was trading multimillion layers of
indemnity insurance on the floor. He got a taste of the free market
trading floor and the concept stuck with him. He started trading his own
account soon after and was able to use the profits to buy a lovely
family home outside of London.

He went back to higher education and began a financial consultancy
company working with a range of UK and European businesses. With this
experience, Mike embarked on a career or training and mentorships with
some of US and UK's top traders.

Mike has a free scalper school webinar coming up on December 14th (7pm
GMT / 2pm ET) [http://tradetheeasyway.com/scalper-school/][1]
