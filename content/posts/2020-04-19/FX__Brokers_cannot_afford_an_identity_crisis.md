#  FX: Brokers cannot afford an identity crisis

The recent withdrawal of Stater Global Markets from the prime-of-prime
broker market has underlined the need for providers to continue to prove
their value to clients.

Aggregated pricing streams are preferable to single bank lines for most
FX trading clients.

Non-bank price-makers have become more influential during the past few
years and for most clients a prime-of-prime (PoP) broker is the only way
to get access to this important liquidity source.

However, [FX PoP brokerage is not an easy market to crack][3].

Stater Global Markets’ [June 3 announcement][4] confirming it was
ceasing its PoP offering referred to the difficulties of competing with
larger rivals, even for a business with a substantial client base and a
strong management team.

While the firm says its decision was prompted by the refusal of [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)
SBL Holdings to put any more money into the business, providers are
[coming under increasing pressure from clients][5] who want to know they
are getting better access to liquidity.

According to IS Prime managing partner Jonathan Brewer, many PoPs
actively market themselves as “true prime of prime”, positioning
themselves solely as a credit intermediary that gives a client access
directly to tier-1 liquidity and even the chance to communicate directly
with [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s.

“This is essentially a watered-down tier-1 prime broker service at a
higher cost, meaning that every one of these clients would go to a
tier-1 prime broker if they were able to and cut out the middle man,” he
says.

“There is no ‘value-add’ to a service that is purely renting the prime
of prime’s balance sheet and charging a premium.”

### Control

Clients accessing a genuine PoP set-up should have much more control
over the liquidity they face and therefore have access to liquidity that
is better than standard margin FX trading.

However, any assessment of the benefits of using a PoP for clients
trading spot FX is complicated by the range of different capital and
credit agreements in place with the broker.

“There is a tendency in the market for prime of prime to not quite be
what it says on the tin, which means the client is not necessarily
getting the service they want and may in fact have more of a standard
margined FX solution,” says Jason Hughes, global head of sales at FX
broker ADSS.

“In a true prime-of-prime scenario, a client should be able to connect
to the liquidity pool they want rather than that defined by their
broker.”

In light of this, it is hardly surprising that some brokers believe the
market would benefit from greater transparency and better understanding
of how PoPs operate.

It is in the interests of some brokers to maintain the ambiguity of what
exactly constitutes a PoP provider, says FXCM’s head of FX prime
brokerage Justin Boulton.

“This way, they can keep calling themselves a prime of prime when in
reality they are just offering liquidity and execution services,” he
says.

“A real prime-of-prime broker is a neutral intermediary that offers a
pure clearing solution with direct market access – it does not operate a
liquidity pool of its own.”

  

### Technology

From a technology perspective, the PoP market has benefited from a focus
on low-latency connectivity and pre-trade risk management.

Credit availability is distributed to the execution venues for ‘at-
trade’ credit checking – reducing any latency induced by routing
execution messages through pre-trade credit checks – and clients with
relatively small collateral balances can now access multiple execution
venues under a single umbrella limit with less risk of rogue algos
breaching the limit.

However, Noel Singh, head of eFX business development at Sucden
Financial, suggests the post-trade segment has been neglected since the
emergence of NetLink, a post-trade system for prime and retail brokers,
with spot trades still taking three days to settle.

Brokers that have traditionally operated in the retail space are now
diversifying their offering to target institutional clients, although
many of the clients leaving bank [prime brokers][10] will still require
a strong balance sheet when choosing their new provider.

“I sense a move within the higher echelon of providers towards a more
traditional prime model, where [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s are disclosed or non-
bank [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s reach clients not supported by prime brokers
through prime-of-prime credit intermediation services – a more pure
prime model than the traditional anonymous aggregated model,” says
Singh.

Gavin White,

Gavin White, CEO at Invast Global, suggests PoPs that can achieve
critical mass will attract interest from acquisitive banks and spark a
wave of consolidation.

“The investment banks will likely be major [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s in boutique firms,”
he concludes.

“They know intimately how profitable a segment it can be and they also
know that they are being forced to offload many clients who are capable
of generating huge value.”
