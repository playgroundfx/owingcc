I have been teaching trading for the last couple of years now. I get
asked repeatedly questions on [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) improve their performance. However,
when they ask, they are not ever really thinking about mindset. Trading
psychology can point to some very destructive habits that we can form
that can really blow up your account.

This podcast is more about the mental tenacity and tricks to Forex
trading and if you are interested in the technical analysis behind the
trades, check out my other podcast, The 10,000 Trades Show at
[www.10000trades.com][1]
