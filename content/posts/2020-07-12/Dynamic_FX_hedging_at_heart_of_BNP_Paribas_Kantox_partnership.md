Corporates' increasing need to use treasury resources more efficiently
has persuaded BNP Paribas to partner with fintech Kantox to offer a new
dynamic hedging solution to clients.

[BNP Paribas][3] has unveiled a strategic partnership with Kantox, an
FX-focused fintech, that will enable EMEA-based treasurers to automate
and streamline [FX workflows][4]. It is designed to complement the range
of products already available on BNP Paribas’ digital banking platform,
Centric.

[Dynamic hedging][5] addresses customer demand for greater efficiency in
FX processes – a demand that is usually driven by a need to use treasury
resources more effectively, explains Xavier Gallant, co-head of
corporate rates, FX and local markets sales EMEA at BNP Paribas.

“One of the key features for customers is that it provides full
automation of treasury processes from identification of currency
exposures to execution and reporting of transactions,” he says.
“Automating low-value-added [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/) such as day-to-day hedging enables
the treasury team to focus on more strategic issues.” These could
include selling bonds or carrying out acquisitions, for example.

The solution also improves the control framework around the execution of
FX, so that rather than involving multiple treasury dealers with
[different approaches to hedging][7], a customer can ensure compliance
with best practice because the rules are set for all currencies and
exposures.

Gallant says the two parties have been in discussions for the last 18
months. “We started by [contact](https://www.playgroundfx.com/contact/)ing selected clients to ascertain their
appetite for dynamic hedging,” he adds. “We have to recognize that every
client has different constraints and treasury systems, so implementation
is a bespoke process.”

BNP Paribas decided to partner with Kantox rather than using a white
label solution because it could get access to a service that was already
being used by more than 100 customers across 12 countries.

“We considered building a product in-house,” says Gallant. “We have a
significant development facility within the bank and have invested
heavily in digital growth. But the reality is that Kantox has developed
a very successful business model and the solution was live and tested.”

This is the first partnership of its type for BNP Paribas in [corporate
FX][8], but Gallant is confident that bank-fintech partnerships will
become more common in this market.

According to Kantox, micro-hedging solutions have already proved that
the impact of transactional FX risk on a company’s P&L can be reduced to
almost zero. Its view is that when markets become volatile ‒ and
particularly when important geopolitical or economic events occur ‒
having an [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) hedging solution that can react in real time makes
all the difference.

### Changing attitudes

When discussing partnerships with banks, [Philippe Gelis, CEO and co-
founder of Kantox][4], has observed that fintechs are always trying to
find the right balance between disclosing enough to make their
technology appealing, while not saying too much.

However, he also believes that banks’ attitudes toward fintech companies
have changed significantly over the last five years. They have realized
that they cannot keep up with the pace of innovation and therefore need
to strike the right balance between investing in and replacing their
older legacy systems.

“We are seeing more of a trend toward banks partnering with or investing
in and acquiring fintech companies,” adds Gelis.

He says there are several reasons why his company has focused on
developing partnerships rather than simply providing a [white label](https://www.fintechee.com/services/forex-broker-white-label/)
solution.

First, a [white label](https://www.fintechee.com/services/forex-broker-white-label/) approach means the provider is simply one of many
technology suppliers to a bank. “We have built unique technology for FX
workflow automation and we want to highlight that, something that is
possible only through co-branding," says Gelis.

"Secondly, our partnerships consist of plugging our software into
clients’ enterprise resource planning systems through our API or FTP
connection and then connecting to banks’ FX liquidity. By nature we will
face the client when deploying our software, so a [white label](https://www.fintechee.com/services/forex-broker-white-label/) approach
makes little sense.”

In August, Kantox announced that it was supplying its dynamic hedging
solution to Silicon Valley Bank. “We appointed a head of bank
partnerships last year to help us really focus on commercial
partnerships and that effort is now paying off,” says Gelis.
