#  Technology vendors eye FX client onboarding opportunity

Regulatory technology vendors are relishing the prospect of helping
banks minimize FX client onboarding errors, but in a world where legacy
systems remain commonplace, regtech is not always an easy sell.

![fx-eye--780][2]

[Anti-money laundering][3] (AML) and [know-your-customer][4] (KYC) [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s require financial institutions to carry out due diligence on their customers. Verifying the identity of these customers is a crucial step in this process and screening names against AML watchlists helps ensure that potential customers have not been associated with financial crimes.

Banks and other institutions don’t want to make the onboarding process
too onerous, but relying on manual processes leaves them exposed to data
entry errors. Client classification and appropriateness rules have also
become more stringent – one of the most telling observations made when
the FX derivatives mis-selling claims came to light was that [brokers
were often completely unaware of the distinction between retail and
wholesale customers][5].

Complex leveraged instruments such as forwards and [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) used for
hedging have in the past been abused by sales teams chasing higher
commission margins without necessarily putting the client first in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/)
of product suitability or risk appetite, notes Remonda Kirketerp-Moller,
founder and CEO of Muinmos, which specializes in [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) regulatory
compliance.

“Corporate SME clients have been onboarded as professional when they
should have been classified as retail, and therefore only appropriate
for less-complex product solutions,” she explains. “It is therefore
highly important that each client passes through a logical and
transparent onboarding process, ensuring that they are fully understood
in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of knowledge and experience, financial situation and investment
objective – including their risk appetite.”

Systems that chart financial institutions’ licences and permissions
across all the jurisdictions in which they operate help create an
accurate digital map of local or regional [regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s and enable cross-
border business to be done reliably and quickly.

“These systems remove the risk of manual errors such as missing updates
and interpretation errors,” adds Kirketerp-Moller. “Aligning this with a
user-friendly workflow creates an accurate audit trail for sales teams,
clients and compliance teams to follow, all of which makes for a faster
and better user experience.”

### Regtech

Automating the onboarding process should mean legal and compliance teams
can be assured that they are up to date with all relevant rules and
[regulation](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-broker-regulation/)s, which removes a lot of risk as well as extensive research
and implementation time. This would allow staff to spend more time
focusing on complex compliance issues.

“By using client onboarding technology, internal compliance and legal
teams can manage regulatory compliance more easily, speeding up their
client onboarding and therefore time to revenue,” says regulatory
software company Heliocor’s chief executive, Owen Hall. “They will also
be able to access trusted data on their customers.”

[Regtech][8] clearly has the potential to release compliance and legal
teams from painstaking manual work. In 2019, ING Bank and Commonwealth
Bank of Australia collaborated with Ascent RegTech to undertake an
assessment of their regulatory obligations and requirements under the
EU's second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II) and
Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Mifir) in a project
overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority.

The technology completed the review in two-and-a-half minutes – a
process that would have taken 1,800 hours (equivalent to a full working
year for a compliance specialist) to complete manually.

The potential rewards for vendors are considerable. A report published
by Grand View Research in August 2019 predicted that the global regtech
market will be worth more than $55 billion by 2025, driven by growth in
[fraud](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fraud/)ulent customer activity and increased demand for risk and
compliance management.

However, many banks and trading firms are still working on legacy
systems that do not allow for easy customization. In addition, the
process of banks onboarding other financial institutions is considered
high-risk and therefore enhanced due diligence typically applies, which
can be a difficult process to persuade banks to automate.

Philip Creed is a director of compliance specialist FSCom, which works
with a number of banks to help them make an annual assessment of the
financial crime risk on their book of FX clients in order to demonstrate
good oversight.

He accepts that too many compliance teams are focused less on the risk
than on the process, which is slow and expensive because these are
typically well-qualified and experienced people.

“The issue is whether the technology is appropriate for the problem the
bank needs to resolve and whether it can leverage the technology without
significant changes to underlying systems,” concludes Creed.
