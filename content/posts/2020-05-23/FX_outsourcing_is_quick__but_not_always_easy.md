Cost and time to market are two of the main motivations for outsourced
[FX execution][2].

[Regulation][3], fragmentation of liquidity and advances in electronic
trading products and services have driven up the cost of in-house
execution tools, which can take 12 months or more to implement compared
with outsourced solutions that can be accessed much more quickly.

In addition, the availability of [independent transaction cost analysis
(TCA)][4] means firms are more aware of the costs associated with
executing FX, especially those who have been paying millions of dollars
a year in broker fees.

However, if an outsourced FX provider is promoting itself as an agent,
buy-side clients need to be sure that the provider is fully acting as a
fiduciary.

So, in cases where the service provider also has a principal business,
clients need to ask whether there are proper separations in place to
ensure that information does not leak from the agency side to the
principal side.

This will usually mean the two sides of the business are separated in
[terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of operation and information, although physical separation can
also be helpful.

### Guidance

Some asset managers will have clarity over their historic FX trading and
processing costs, and will therefore have clear expectations of the
costs involved, whereas others may require considerable guidance.

Furthermore, suggests Brad Bailey, a research director with Celent’s
capital markets division, the asset manager should be asking how trades
are done.

Once the client understands the business model, it then needs to ask
what regulatory reporting capabilities are in place, says Integral chief
revenue officer Vikas Srivastava.

“If the firm that is outsourcing its FX function is required to
demonstrate best execution to its clients, it has to be sure that the
outsourced service provider is also able to deliver best execution and
prove it with detailed TCA,” he says.

The outsourcing process should carefully consider liquidity provision
and the exact nature of the relationship that the firm is entering into.

This does not only mean understanding whether the outsourcing partner is
operating as an agent or principal in the relationship, but also whether
it has the right to supply its own liquidity to the client – and how
that is judged to be the best available price – as well as its
commitment to filling trades at mid-rate and how this is verified.

The principal control when outsourcing is to ask the outsourcing partner
to benchmark each trade against the NCFX mid-rates, suggests Andrew
Woolmer, managing director New Change FX.

“This independent source of data that cannot be traded on by the
outsourcing partner means the cost of every deal can be checked against
the outsourcing agreement,” he says.

### Conflict of interest

If vendors provide order-level execution details to their clients, those
clients will be able to uncover any potential conflict of interest by
reviewing the trading data, adds Pragma chief business officer Curtis
Pfeiffer.

“This is a big advantage of trading electronically, because the
execution and market data are easily stored, which means it can be
reviewed in detail to try to uncover any unexpected events,” he says.

“Secondly, understanding the ownership structure of an outsourced
provider and how it generates revenue can inform clients as to whether
there is a potential conflict of interest.”

Ideally, clients should have an [automated](https://www.fintechee.com/features/automated-forex-trading/) process in place that captures
every deal and compares its cost to the firm’s tolerances for the size
of deal, pair and instrument, with instant alerts for anything exceeding
the company’s [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) for FX so that action can be taken before a trade
settles.

Firms should also consider implementing a monthly review process that
checks overall costs and regularly calling brokers to ensure they remain
compliant with the firm’s cost targets.

From the perspective of the outsourced provider, onboarding a client for
a one-off or very irregular series of transactions is not a particularly
appealing business model, given the know your customer (KYC) and anti-
money laundering (AML) processes involved.

“Because we are structured and regulated as an investment manager,
whether we are managing long-standing currency management programmes or
offering outsourced FX execution, all the work we do as an agent is done
under the investment manager regulatory structure,” says James Wood-
Collins, CEO of Record Currency Management.

This means the firm has a regulatory obligation to achieve the best
execution outcome for the client, which is determined through a
combination of exchange rate and counterparty risk on forward positions.
