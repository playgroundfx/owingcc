_There have been a number of unwinds by European fashion retailers,
according to Deutsche Bank_

  

Many treasurers have found themselves with higher than expected hedge
ratios as a consequence of reduced revenues caused by coronavirus
restrictions.

Where corporate treasuries run [anticipated cash-flow hedging][2]
programmes based on sales/costs forecasts, under normal circumstances
they tend to be under-hedged to allow for forecast errors on these
programmes. But given the unprecedented impact of coronavirus on the
global economy, there will be cases of corporates that are [over-hedged
for their revised forecasts][3].

As with so many other aspects of the pandemic, the effects on treasury
have been unevenly distributed.

Many businesses exporting from Europe were running small hedge ratios
anyway due to low volatility and fairly high hedging costs.

Those forced to temporarily suspend production tend to see their cost
base as stable from a long-term perspective and therefore treat any
potential over-hedge more like a timing mismatch than an actual open
position.

### Misalignment

There have also been cases where there is an expectation of a ramp-up
effect towards the end of the year, says Ole Matthiessen, head of cash
management corporate banking at Deutsche Bank.

“Specific industries such as travel, leisure and fashion retail have
been impacted much more heavily than others in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of over-hedging,”
he says. “Virtually all clients in these sectors have reported
misalignments between their hedging instruments and their underlying
business forecast.”

Fabio Madar, co-head of currencies at Natwest Markets, says as many as a
quarter of treasurers could be over-hedged, although those whose
business has been delayed rather than cancelled have in many cases
simply rolled their hedges forward.

“If there is certainty that the hedge is now ‘orphan’, they might need
to cancel them and pay or receive the difference with the current FX
spot,” Madar says.

“The treasurer would then have to wait for more clarity to initiate new
hedges. If they are not sure that the hedge will be useful and have
little visibility about their real exposure, they could choose to
transform their forwards into [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/).”

### Strategies

Strategies available to treasurers to reduce their exposure when they
are over-hedged in a specific currency or currencies depend on the
profile of their order books explains Xavier Gallant, co-head of rates,
FX & local markets corporate sales EMEA at BNP Paribas.

“Companies with ‘in the money’ hedges could monetise their positive mark
to market by closing out their over-hedged positions or roll their
hedges to a future date,” he says. “This can be attractive especially in
emerging markets, given the price action of these currencies against the
euro this year.”

If the portfolio is out of the money, a roll to a future date could be
considered but would trigger negative cash flows on day one if the rolls
are done at market as the client would need to pay the current mark to
market.

An alternative solution is to look at restructuring the hedge portfolio
to reduce the monthly hedging commitment and spread it to longer
maturities.

Matthiessen says he has seen a number of unwinds by European fashion
retailers as many had positive market values in their portfolio due to
long-dated USD forward purchase contracts, leading to a windfall gain
that partially compensated for reduced business activities.

“Adjusting tenors and aligning hedge ratios in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of maturity profile
has become a more common practice over recent years,” he adds. “We have
seen a lot of this activity over the last three months, both in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of
tactical solutions, but also through strategic portfolio alignments.”

Francois Masquelier, vice-chairman of the European Association of
Corporate Treasurers, has referred to how over-hedged positions create
problems under hedge accounting rules, with complex delinking and
reallocation of hedges. However, he also warned that this might not
necessarily be a good time to unwind hedges.  

### Reviews

Gallant similarly cautions against removing hedges for currencies to
which corporates have limited exposure, recommending instead a review of
hedging practices (such as hedge ratio and duration) and adjustment of
the product mix in the hedge portfolio.

“Options could be a way to address the lack of visibility in future cash
flows, as they remove any obligation for the corporate to transact
should the exposure not materialise,” he says. “Other simple strategies,
packaged as zero-premium solutions, may offer flexibility on the hedged
amount as well as on the timing of settlement, removing the two main
sources of uncertainty in the hedging decision.”

Gallant also notes that the pros and cons of these strategies need to be
considered in the context of each company’s objectives, liquidity needs
and potential pressure on FX/rates lines and agrees that hedge
accounting repercussions should also be carefully analysed.
