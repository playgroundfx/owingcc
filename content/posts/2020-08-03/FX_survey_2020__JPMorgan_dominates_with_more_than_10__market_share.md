JPMorgan’s market share of 10.78% [in this year’s survey][2] was up from
9.81% in 2019 and well ahead of UBS with 8.13%. XTX and Deutsche Bank
were not far behind, but then it is quite a gap to last year’s third-
placed Citi in fifth.

  

One of the factors likely to have contributed to JPMorgan’s strong
showing is its electronic trading capabilities.

  

Renowned for investing big sums in technology, earlier this year the
bank’s FX e-commerce team was talking about a big increase in volumes of
algos for tickets with a notional value above $10 million, with almost
two thirds of these orders traded algorithmically in March alone.

UBS has also benefitted from investment in its FX business, including
becoming the first global bank to launch an e-FX pricing and trading
engine in Singapore in 2019. In addition, the Swiss bank took steps last
year towards folding its FX, rates and credit group into a single
securities unit.

XTX has firmly hitched its wagon to the anti-last look movement over the
last 12 months, a move that seems to have gone down well with clients as
it moved up from fourth place last year.

### Positive clients

This time last year some analysts were warning that exiting equities and
rates would negatively impact Deutsche Bank’s FX franchise. But clients
have reacted positively to the bank’s latest restructuring and its
decision to have a single salesforce selling FX to all corporates
clients rather than servicing smaller corporates through the retail
franchise.

Further down the [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s, Jump Trading lived up to its name by
advancing from 11th in 2019 to seventh position this year. In the lower
tier, Alfa Bank was the big mover rising from 38th to 24th.

There was a new category to fight for this year in the form of disclosed
business, where we discarded all anonymised flows.

During Euromoney’s conversations with leading [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s, it
had become clear that while they understood the reasoning for including
anonymised volume in the overall [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/), it would be helpful for those
who didn’t do that type of business to be able to benchmark themselves
against others with a similar strategy and reflect genuine client
relationships.

FX [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s do not want liquidity to become fragmented, as has happened
in other markets, but they do want more choice in how they trade and
with whom.

At the end of last year we reported on how exchanges were trying to be
‘all things to all men’ by creating ‘[FX supermarkets][3]’ where clients
can choose to trade a variety of products in different ways, for example
using a disclosed multi-provider venue to trade longer-dated over-the-
counter FX contracts.

It might have been a new category, but it has a familiar face at the
top, with JPMorgan once again coming first, this time followed by UBS
and HSBC.

If swaps were included, JPMorgan would still top the liquidity [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s,
although Deutsche would now occupy second spot with UBS in third place.

### Banks

Deutsche was last year’s surprise package, rising from eighth to second
in the overall [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s. While the German firm gave back some of those
gains this year it did come top in the bank category, swapping places
with last year’s winner JPMorgan, which came third in the latest
[ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s behind UBS.

Corporate specialist HSBC maintained top spot in the non-financial
corporates segment, where Bank of America Securities was the big mover,
up to second this year from seventh in 2019.

Among leveraged funds JPMorgan secured top position this year, while UBS
moved up from fourth to second.

The most notable change in this segment was Bank of New York Mellon,
which took third place despite being ranked only 18th in 2019.

Real money market share was much more consistent with last year’s
results. State Street retained its top [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) from 2019 with HSBC
(fifth last year) and Citi – down from second to third – making up the
top three.

### Brokers

The segment formerly referred to as ‘FX trading platforms’ was this year
renamed ‘all undisclosed and retail brokers’. Again, this was based on
feedback from banks who felt that the classification of FX trading
platform had become confusing.

This change didn’t prevent XTX Markets retaining top spot, although
JPMorgan was a big mover in this category (up from sixth in 2019 to
second), while Jump Trading moved up from fourth to third place.

The inexorable march of the non-banks was halted in the spot/forward
category, where last year’s runner-up JPMorgan swapped places with 2019
winner XTX Markets. Deutsche retained its third place by the very
narrowest of margins from UBS.

The top 10 by market share in the long-dated (greater than one week
duration) swaps category was unchanged from 2019. However, there was an
eye-catching change at the top of the [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/)s with HSBC leaping from
sixth place last year to gain top spot. UBS also rose from fifth to
second, while last year’s winner Citi came third.

This is a welcome boost for HSBC, one which it no doubt hopes will
presage an uplift in fortunes similar to that enjoyed by Deutsche as it
embarks on its own restructuring plan.

### Swaps

When all swaps are considered, Deutsche (seventh in the long-dated swaps
category) assumes top [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) with Citi moving from first place in 2019
to second ahead of HSBC, which moves up from sixth place last year.

Deutsche also came out on top in the [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) category, rising from third
place in 2019 and swapping places with JPMorgan. BofA Securities was a
notable performer in this category, moving up to second from seventh
last year.

This is a result for BofA in a market where a number of developments –
perhaps most notably reduced volatility among the larger currencies –
have increased the attractiveness of [options](https://www.fixpro.org/post/options-liquidity/) as a tool for reducing
currency exposure.

### Emerging markets

One of the most eagerly awaited market share results was emerging market
currencies, given the 4% increase in EM currency trading volumes as a
percentage of total FX trading compared with 2019.

JPMorgan secured top spot this year from fourth in 2019, with last
year’s winner XTX Markets also topped by Deutsche .

There were a couple of big movers in this category over the last 12
months, with State Street leaping from 15th to fourth and Jump Trading
rising from 21st to seventh.

Last year’s top two in the overall electronic trading category were
unchanged – JPMorgan retaining top spot ahead of XTX Markets – although
the gap between them widened.

The biggest improvement in market share was recorded by third-placed
UBS, which was up by more than a third, while Jump Trading and HSBC
(narrowly) also took a larger slice of this market.

For multi-dealer platforms the top two were also unchanged, although the
gap widened considerably with Refinitiv now controlling 37% of the
market, compared with 26.2% for GlobalLink.

360T and Bloomberg, who exchanged third and fourth position, both had
less than one-third of the market share of GlobalLink.

### Customer satisfaction

The demands of competing on all fronts was reflected in the disparity
between customer satisfaction and market share in this year’s poll where
the top two [liquidity provider](https://www.fintechee.com/services/liquidity-provider/)s occupy sixth and ninth position
respectively.

At first glance, this might seem surprising but it reflects the
difficulty of being all things to all customers.

The likes of JPMorgan, Deutsche and HSBC cover multiple client and
product segments, and it is extremely difficult to keep such a diverse
group of clients with such a wide range of needs and priorities happy
all the time.

In contrast, an XTX or State Street have a more niche group of clients
and service offering.

ninth by market volume) come out on top

The overall customer satisfaction [ranking](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/crypto-exchange-ranking/) saw State Street (ranked ninth
by market volume) come out on top, moving up from second in last year’s
ratings.

There were several big moves in the top 10, with Bank of New York Mellon
taking second spot, having been ranked fifth last year, while Deutsche
rose from 21st in 2019 to fifth position and RBC Capital Markets jumped
from 20th last year to seventh in 2020.

UBS and HSBC in ninth and 10th position are the other newcomers in the
top 10 this year.

Morgan Stanley came top in the algorithmic trading segment, while State
Street was ranked first for service and Bank of New York Mellon won in
both the research and Salesforce categories.

This year’s winner Refinitiv swapped places with Bloomberg in the multi-
dealer platforms category.

A new customer satisfaction category – ability in emerging market
(central and eastern European, Latin American and Asian) currencies –
was won by Citi, narrowly ahead of Bank of New York Mellon with HSBC in
third.

Euromoney is particularly interested in the outcome of this category as
it has been looking at ways of measuring performance in emerging markets
for some time to see if a smaller bank could usurp a larger rival by
offering really good service in niche currencies.

The result reflects Citi’s strength in the Americas in particular.
