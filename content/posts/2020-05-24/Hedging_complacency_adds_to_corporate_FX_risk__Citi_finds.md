#  Hedging complacency adds to corporate FX risk, Citi finds

Citi’s latest global corporate benchmarking survey shows that companies
are worryingly complacent about their potential exposure to emerging
market currencies and remain reliant on manual processes to manage risk.

Emerging markets are a growth sweet spot for many corporates. But
concerns around economic stagnation and trade relations have weighed
heavily on emerging market currencies as the US and China continue to
butt heads over tariffs.

In this context it might be expected that corporates operating in
emerging markets would have a distinct market [hedging [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/)][3] for
currencies outside the G10 group of nations. Yet although more than 80%
of respondents to Citi’s recent global corporate benchmarking survey
reported having exposures to emerging market currencies, a similar
percentage admitted that they didn’t differentiate between emerging
market and developed market hedging practices.

Jaya Dutt, global head of risk management solutions for corporate FX at
[Citi][5], says that while most of the companies surveyed have an
enterprise resource planning (ERP) or treasury management system (TMS)
in place, integration between these systems is limited and risk
management processes remain largely manual.

“As a consequence they are relying on the hedging policies they already
have in place and are constantly looking to revamp these policies, which
extend across the full breadth of their FX risk,” she says. “This can
lead to capital losses and have a negative impact on loans taken out by
local subsidiaries if risk practices don’t take account of emerging
market currency volatility and liquidity.”

More than 90% of survey respondents have implemented cash-flow
forecasting methodologies to improve visibility into future multi-
currency cash positions and help identify natural offsets and
opportunities for more effective liquidity and currency risk management.
However, almost three in four (72%) rely on manual inputs as part of the
forecasting process.

### Inconsistencies

There are many processes that are still supported manually across
treasury organizations, admits the EMEA head of Citi’s treasury [advisor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/expert-advisor/)y
group, Duncan Cole.

“Automation technology is available and affordable, but there are
inconsistencies in deployment,” he says. “Coupled with the fracture in
connectivity between TMS and ERP systems (in some cases multiple ERP
systems) where the underlying commercial flows are, this leads to the
use of manual processes to connect data.”

Almost two thirds of the companies who participated in the survey noted
that their TMS was either not integrated or only partially integrated
with their ERP system, which provides the required underlying business
data to identify risk exposures.

Another area of missed opportunity highlighted in the survey relates to
intercompany netting, where all the subsidiaries in a corporate group
make payments to – and receive payments from – a clearing house or
netting centre for net obligations due from other subsidiaries in the
group. Fewer than half of the companies surveyed by Citi use
intercompany netting.

“Intercompany netting is one of the first steps to driving treasury
efficiency,” says Cole. “Intercompany flows are often a source of noise
when treasury is trying to consolidate its true liquidity exposure
because of manual reconciliation and settlement between subsidiary
companies. Even when a company has deployed intercompany netting – which
we see as being the first step towards creating an in-house bank for
managing FX risk centrally – it often doesn’t include all the
intercompany flows.”

The fact that 9% of respondents to the benchmarking survey didn't have a
formal FX risk management [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) also seems puzzling.

Erik Johnson, global co-ordinator for CitiFX risk solutions, notes that
for some of these businesses – particularly those which only operate
within their domestic market – FX will have a limited marginal impact,
although he recommends that such companies still have a [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/), if only
to clarify their response to an unexpected event.

One encouraging finding from the survey was that 71% of companies
reviewed their FX risk [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) at least once a year.

“In the past a review would usually only take place following an
acquisition or a change in the business model,” says Johnson. “We see
increased demand for studies looking at the impact of changes to
volatility on portfolio risk. In a market characterized by low
volatility and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, there is an
opportunity for corporates to take a step back and use informed data and
analytics to [optimize](https://www.fintecher.org/2020/03/17/added-genetic-algorithm-for-trading/) currency risk.”
